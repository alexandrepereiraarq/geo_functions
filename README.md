# Geographic Information Functions (geo_functions)

## Description
This repo hosts some geographic information data acquisition and management functions I use in my work. Any question just message me or include an issue here.
Currently, I have the following functions under development:
- [Raster clip to AOI](https://gitlab.lrz.de/0000000001364670/geo_functions/-/blob/main/src/data/01_raster_clip_by_AOI.ipynb?ref_type=heads): just provide an AOI geopandas geodataframe and it will clip the raster to its extents and adjust the CRS to that of the AOI
- [Vector clip to AOI](https://gitlab.lrz.de/0000000001364670/geo_functions/-/blob/main/src/data/02_vector_clip_by_AOI.ipynb?ref_type=heads): the same as the raster clip, above, but works with vector geodataframes.
- [Overpass road download and clean](https://gitlab.lrz.de/0000000001364670/geo_functions/-/blob/main/src/data/03_road_import_by_AOI.ipynb?ref_type=heads) (initially developed by Otavio Martins Peres and adapted by me)
